# Maternal Mortality: An Analysis of Influencing Factors

## Overview

This project investigates the factors influencing global maternal mortality rates, using data from 2015. Maternal mortality refers to deaths caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth, a critical public health issue as approximately 84% of these deaths are preventable.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes data from the **QOG Standard Dataset** and **Kaggle**.

## Variables

The following independent variables were examined for their impact on maternal mortality rates:

-   **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**

-   **Human Development Index (HDI)**

-   **Current Health Expenditure**

-   **Current Education Expenditure**

-   **Comparative Abortion Index (CAI)**

## Methodology

The study employed the following techniques:

1.  **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Analysis**

2.  **Partial Regression Plots**

3.  **Regression Coefficient Visualization**

## Key Findings

-   The model demonstrated a strong fit, achieving an R-squared value of **0.856**.

-   At the **5% significance level**, only **HDI** and **CAI** emerged as statistically significant predictors of maternal mortality.

## Limitations

Several limitations were identified in this analysis:

-   **Temporal Scope:** The data is restricted to 2015, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

-   **Incomplete Data:** Some countries lacked complete data, introducing potential bias.

-   **Excluded Variables:** Certain variables of interest were omitted due to missing values.

## Conclusion

This project highlights critical factors influencing maternal mortality and underscores the importance of addressing preventable causes to reduce global maternal mortality rates. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions in healthcare, education, and socio-economic policies to improve maternal health outcomes worldwide.
